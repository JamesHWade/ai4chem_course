Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. We can use Streamlit to create a web app that will allow us to interact with our model.\n",

We use the code in this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/victorsabanza/reaxplorer) as an example. You can have a look to the deployed app by clicking on the Streamlit badge above (don't worry, we will explain step by step the code to create it)."
